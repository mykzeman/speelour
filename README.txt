Welcome to Speelour! The fully automatic speech-to-colour system! 

Instructions:

1. Press the "listen" button to start capturing your voice. You may need to give your microphone access! 
2. Speak into the microphone and watch the colour fully come to life!
3. Enjoy!

Notes:

There is no button to turn off Speelour, so close it to prevent it from listening to your voice.

Speech results may not be accurate.

It only works with single-word colours, so "Rebecca purple" cannot be used.

It only works online so you have to have an internet connection.

Do not look at the console, as there may be many errors.

It only works on PCs (not phones).

We cannot control how sensitive the speech recognition is, so it may take a couple of tries to see results.



Version 10 or something like that. I haven't checked all the versions; there were too many to count. I'm not the most fabulous counter.
